# ts-node-template

Typescript Node barebone boilerplate. This basic architecture consists of:

- Node
- Typescript
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- ESLint
- Prettier
- ts-node-dev
- VS Code debugger

## `pnpm install`

to install the dependencies

## `pnpm start`

to start the app with `ts-node-dev` or `tsnd` alias
much faster that `nodemon`

## `pnpm debug`

to start the app with `ts-node-dev` and debugger attached

But before, in VS Code press Command + Shift + P and select Debug: Toggle Auto Attach -> Only With Flag

## `pnpm build`

to build everything inside the `src/` folder and output JS files to `dist/` folder

## `pnpm serve`

to launch the production build of the app using `node ./dist/index.js`

## `pnpm dep:update`

to upgrade all npm packages to their latest versions
